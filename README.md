## Turing Final Assessment


[Link to server repository](https://github.com/kerrd89/expert-train)

create-react-app doesn't sync with heroku, unless you use the special heroku create-react-app cli which I discovered at the end.

because of this, I had to split my server and application, deploy the server to heroku and the application to gh pages.

thanks!
